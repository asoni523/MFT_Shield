# MFT Shield: A Framework for Anomaly Detection in Managed File Transfers

This project provides an end-to-end anomaly detection framework for Managed File Transfer (MFT) systems. Using server logs, network logs, and file transfer logs, we apply machine learning to detect potential anomalies and security breaches.
